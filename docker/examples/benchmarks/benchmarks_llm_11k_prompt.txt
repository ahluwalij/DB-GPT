OceanBase Database is a completely self-developed enterprise-level native distributed database that achieves financial-grade high availability on ordinary hardware. It pioneered the "three locations and five centers" city-level disaster recovery standard for automatic lossless disaster recovery, refreshed the TPC-C standard test, with a single cluster scale of more than 1,500 nodes, and features such as cloud-native, strong consistency, and high compatibility with Oracle/MySQL.

Core Features
High Availability
The unique "three locations and five centers" disaster recovery architecture solution establishes a new standard for lossless disaster recovery in the financial industry. It supports local/remote disaster recovery and can achieve multi-site active-active configuration, meeting the financial industry's level 6 disaster recovery standards (RPO=0, RTO<8s) with zero data loss.

High Compatibility
Highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL, covering most common functions, supporting advanced features such as procedural languages and triggers, providing automatic migration tools, supporting migration assessment and reverse synchronization to ensure data migration security. It can support core scenario replacement for key industries such as finance, government, and telecommunications.

Horizontal Scaling
Implements transparent horizontal scaling, supporting rapid expansion and contraction of business, while achieving high performance through quasi-memory processing architecture. Supports cluster nodes exceeding thousands, with maximum single cluster data volume exceeding 3PB, and maximum single table row count reaching trillion level.

Low Cost
Based on LSM-Tree high compression engine, storage costs are reduced by 70%-90%; natively supports multi-tenant architecture, allowing the same cluster to serve multiple independent businesses with data isolation between tenants, reducing deployment and operation costs.

Real-time HTAP
Based on "one data, one engine", it simultaneously supports online real-time transactions and real-time analysis scenarios. "One data" can be stored in multiple forms across multiple replicas for different workloads, fundamentally maintaining data consistency.

Security and Reliability
12 years of completely independent research and development, code-level controllability, self-developed single-machine distributed integrated architecture, 9 years of reliability verification in large-scale financial core scenarios; complete role and permission management system, full-link transparent encryption for data storage and communication, supporting national cryptographic algorithms, passing Level 3 equal protection special compliance testing.
