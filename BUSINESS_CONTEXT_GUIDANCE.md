# Business Context Guidance for PostgreSQL Connections

## Overview

When users connect a PostgreSQL database to DB-GPT, they are now automatically guided to create business context that will enhance their data analysis experience. This feature makes the system more business-focused and user-friendly for non-technical users.

## Features Implemented
